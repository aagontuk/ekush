Ekush is a drawing tool based on python turtle. Few days back while riding a bus, I came to know about the turtle module from a Python Basic book. I planned in this International Mother Language Day 2019 I will draw '[Shaheed Minar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheed_Minar,_Dhaka)' using turtle. From that plan this tool springs.

### Example ###

If you wan to generate this drawing of 'Shaheed Minar' in your machine, donwload this repository and run shaheed_minar.py .
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/aagontuk/ekush
$ cd ekush
$ python shaheed_minar.py
```
